# ml-models
A collection of machine learning models built from scratch.

### CODE:
All the model code is under **./models**
<br>All of the optimizer code is under **./optimizers**
<br>All of the loss code is under **./loss**

### EXAMPLES:
All examples with generated data and visuals that utilize the functions and classes I have built are under **./examples**

### Derivations :
<br>
If you are interested in how I derived any of the models, loss functions or derivatives (gradients) of loss function,
feel free to check out the **./derivations** folder which has step-by-step Jupyter Notebooks walking through the math and code.
