# ml-models
A collection of machine learning models built from scratch.

All the model code is under **./models**
All of the optimizer code is under **./optimizers**
All of the loss code is under **./loss**

If you are interested in how I derived any of the models, loss functions or derivatives (gradients) of loss function,
feel free to check out the **./derivations** folder which has step-by-step Jupyter Notebooks walking through the math and code.
